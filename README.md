# J.P.Morgan-Software Engineering Virtual Experience
# Introduction
The repository includes the implementations of various tasks when I participating the Software Engineering Virtual Experience in  [J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/R5iK7HMxJGBgaSbvk/Software%20Engineering%20Virtual%20Experience?ref=cEn4asrDvXquYSBnp)

For this project, a trader from the equities team (publicly listed company stocks) has requested functionality be added to their dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can monitor a new trading strategy.

In order to do this, I have set up the system so I could interface with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real time.

The visualization of charts and data analysis is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own open sourced software called Perspective. I learned how to implement this to facilitate the traderâ€™s requested changes and deliver actionable insights.

# Tasks
- Task1:
    - Set up the system and fix the broken client datafeed script in the repository by making the required adjustments to it.
    - Generate a patch file of the changes I made.

- Task2:
    - Set up the system and fix the client-side web application so that it displays a graph that automatically updates as it gets data from the server application.
    - Generate a patch file of the changes I made.
    
- Task3:
    - Use perspective to generate a live graph that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing way for traders to monitor this trading strategy.


# Perspective

JPMorgan Chase created the Perspective tool over many years to allows users to present and manipulate data feeds visually in web applications.

Perspective provides a set of flexible data transforms, such as pivots, filters, and aggregations. It utilizes bleeding-edge browser technology such as Web Assembly and Apache Arrow and is unmatched in browser performance. It is engineered for reliability and production-vetted on the JPMorgan Chase trading floor and is now available to the development community as Open Source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section.
